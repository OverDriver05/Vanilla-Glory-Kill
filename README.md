# Vanilla-Glory-Kill
This is the primary repository for the collaborative efforts between Doom developers for "Vanilla Glory Kill", a gameplay add-on for Doom (1994) and Doom 2: Hell on Earth. This is the bleeding-edge version that is constantly being developed on, and not meant in any way shape or form to be representative of the final version of the mod.
