# Vanilla Glory Kill
This is the primary repository for the collaborative efforts between Doom developers for "Vanilla Glory Kill", a gameplay add-on for Doom (1994) and Doom 2: Hell on Earth.
This is the bleeding-edge version that is constantly being developed on, and not meant in any way shape or form to be representative of the final version of the mod.

# What is "Vanilla Glory Kill"?
Ever wonder what happens if DOOM (2016) was instead released back in 1994? The "Vanilla Glory Kill" is a gameplay mod for Doom (1994) and Doom II: Hell on Earth, designed with one thing in mind: To give the classic Doom duology a classically-modern cherry on top by giving Doomguy the ability to gloriously rip and tear through Hell's armies with his own bare hands (and sometimes with the help of his huge arsenal). 
In other words, this gameplay mod introduces "Glory Kills" long before their 2016 successor actually did! 
Using Redxone Gaming's "Universal Glory Kill" mod, the "Vanilla Glory Kill" was designed to be compatible with EVERY Doom Gameplay/TC (Total Conversion)/Slaughtermap/Gore mod(s) ever, with an extra care for mobile source ports such as "Doom Touch" and "Delta Touch".
